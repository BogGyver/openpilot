Welcome to openpilot
======

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driving agent. Currently it performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) for Hondas, Acuras, Toyotas, and a Chevy. It's about on par with Tesla Autopilot and GM Super Cruise, and better than [all other manufacturers](http://www.thedrive.com/tech/5707/the-war-for-autonomous-driving-part-iii-us-vs-germany-vs-japan).

The openpilot codebase has been written to be concise and enable rapid prototyping. We look forward to your contributions - improving real vehicle automation has never been easier.

Hardware
------

Right now openpilot supports the [EON Dashcam DevKit](https://comma.ai/shop/products/eon-dashcam-devkit). We'd like to support other platforms as well.

Install openpilot on a neo device by entering ``https://openpilot.comma.ai`` during NEOS setup.

<sup>1</sup>[Comma Pedal](https://community.comma.ai/wiki/index.php/Comma_Pedal) is used to provide stop-and-go capability to some of the openpilot-supported cars that don't currently support stop-and-go. Here is how to [build a Comma Pedal](https://medium.com/@jfrux/comma-pedal-building-with-macrofab-6328bea791e8). ***NOTE: The Comma Pedal is not officially supported by [comma.ai](https://comma.ai)***  
<sup>2</sup>When disconnecting the Driver Support Unit (DSU), otherwise longitudinal control is stock ACC. For DSU locations, see [Toyota Wiki page](https://community.comma.ai/wiki/index.php/Toyota)  
<sup>3</sup>[GM installation guide](https://www.zoneos.com/volt.htm)  
<sup>4</sup>It needs an extra 120Ohm resistor ([pic1](https://i.imgur.com/CmdKtTP.jpg), [pic2](https://i.imgur.com/s2etUo6.jpg)) on bus 3 and giraffe switches set to 01X1 (11X1 for stock LKAS), where X depends on if you have the [comma power](https://comma.ai/shop/products/power/).  
<sup>5</sup>28mph for Camry 4CYL L, 4CYL LE and 4CYL SE which don't have Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.

[[Honda Fit Pull Request]](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/pull/266).

Community Maintained Cars are not confirmed by comma.ai to meet our safety model. Be extra cautious using them.

In Progress Cars
------
- All TSS-P Toyota with Steering Assist.
  - 'Full Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control' is required to enable stop-and-go. Only the Prius, Camry and C-HR have this option.
  - Even though the Tundra, Sequoia and the Land Cruiser have TSS-P, they don't have Steering Assist and are not supported.
- All LSS-P Lexus with Steering Assist or Lane Keep Assist.
  - 'All-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control' is required to enable stop-and-go. Only the GS, GSH, F, RX, RXH, LX, NX, NXH, LC, LCH, LS, LSH have this option.
  - Even though the LX have TSS-P, it does not have Steering Assist and is not supported.

How can I add support for my car?
------

If your car has adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist, you are in luck. Using a [panda](https://comma.ai/shop/products/panda-obd-ii-dongle/) and [cabana](https://community.comma.ai/cabana/), you can understand how to make your car drive by wire.

We've written guides for [Brand](https://medium.com/@comma_ai/how-to-write-a-car-port-for-openpilot-7ce0785eda84) and [Model](https://medium.com/@comma_ai/openpilot-port-guide-for-toyota-models-e5467f4b5fe6) ports. These guides might help you after you have the basics figured out.

- BMW, Audi, Volvo, and Mercedes all use [FlexRay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlexRay) and are unlikely to be supported any time soon.
- We put time into a Ford port, but the steering has a 10 second cutout limitation that makes it unusable.
- The 2016-2017 Honda Accord use a custom signaling protocol for steering that's unlikely to ever be upstreamed.

User Data / chffr Account / Crash Reporting
------

By default openpilot creates an account and includes a client for chffr, our dashcam app. We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.

It's open source software, so you are free to disable it if you wish.

It logs the road facing camera, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The user facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings.
It does not log the microphone.

By using it, you agree to [our privacy policy](https://community.comma.ai/privacy.html). You understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of comma.ai. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to comma.ai for the use of this data.

Testing on PC
------

There is rudimentary infrastructure to run a basic simulation and generate a report of openpilot's behavior in different scenarios.

```bash
# Requires working docker
./run_docker_tests.sh
```

The resulting plots are displayed in `selfdrive/test/tests/plant/out/longitudinal/index.html`

More extensive testing infrastructure and simulation environments are coming soon.
