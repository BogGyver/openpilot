Welcome to panda
======

[panda](http://github.com/commaai/panda) is the nicest universal car interface ever.

It supports 3x CAN, 2x LIN, and 1x GMLAN. It also charges a phone. On the computer side, it has both USB and Wi-Fi.

It uses an [STM32F413](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f413-423.html?querycriteria=productId=LN2004) for low level stuff and an [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) for Wi-Fi. They are connected over high speed SPI, so the panda is actually capable of dumping the full contents of the busses over Wi-Fi, unlike every other dongle on amazon. ELM327 is weak, panda is strong.

It is 2nd gen hardware, reusing code and parts from the [NEO](https://github.com/commaai/neo) interface board.

Usage (Python)
------

To install the library:
```
# pip install pandacan
```

See [this class](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/python/__init__.py#L80) for how to interact with the panda.

For example, to receive CAN messages:
```
>>> from panda import Panda
>>> panda = Panda()
>>> panda.can_recv()
```
And to send one on bus 0:
```
>>> panda.can_send(0x1aa, "message", 0)
```

Usage (JavaScript)
-------

Software interface support
------

As a universal car interface, it should support every reasonable software interface.

- [User space](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/python)
- [socketcan in kernel](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/drivers/linux) (alpha)
- [ELM327](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/boardesp/elm327.c)
- [Windows J2534](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/drivers/windows)

Programming (over USB)
------

[Programming the ESP](boardesp/README.md)


Debugging
------

To print out the serial console from the STM32, run tests/debug_console.py

To print out the serial console from the ESP8266, run PORT=1 tests/debug_console.py

Safety Model
------

When a panda powers up, by default it's in "SAFETY_NOOUTPUT" mode. While in no output mode, the buses are also forced to be silent. In order to send messages, you have to select a safety mode. Currently, setting safety modes is only supported over USB.

Safety modes can also optionally support "controls_allowed", which allows or blocks a subset of messages based on a piece of state in the board.

Hardware
------

Licensing
------

panda software is released under the MIT license unless otherwise specified.
